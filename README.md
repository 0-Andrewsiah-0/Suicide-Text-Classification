# Suicide-Text-Classification 

A rise in suicide rates worldwide has become a major public health concern, causing 
the development of new methods for early diagnosis and prevention. Traditional methods of 
detecting individuals at risk of suicide frequently rely on self-reporting and professional 
assessments, which can be limited due to judgment, a lack of access to mental health care, and 
a delay in action. In response, the rise of digital technologies 
offers an effective strategy for preventive suicide prevention. This research seeks to create a 
reliable suicide text detection system that uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine 
learning approaches to detect distress signs in textual communication. By analyzing social 
media posts, messages, and other text-based interactions, this system seeks to provide timely 
alerts and facilitate interventions before a crisis occurs. The effective implementation of such 
a system might greatly improve existing mental health support frameworks, ultimately 
contributing to a decrease in suicide rates and better public health outcomes .
